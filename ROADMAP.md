FlutterGPT Roadmap
---------------

This document is designed to be a living record of the current and projected
priorities for the fluttergpt project. It is, of course, always subject to change
and exists solely to give the community an idea of where we're going. The
roadmap is set by the fluttergpt core team. If you have feature suggestions for
fluttergpt, please submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Welltested-AI/fluttergpt/issues)
and, if of sufficient size and approved by the team, it will be added here. If
you have concerns about the roadmap, you can e-mail the devs at
`team@welltested.ai` or raise a GitHub issue. Note that
bugfixes and miscellaneous features are not considered "roadmap projects", and
will be addressed in the due course of normal development. This page
exists to outline large-scale future plans for fluttergpt.
