<h3 align="center">Integrate APIs, SDKs or Packages with AI Agents</h3>
<img src="/assets/docs/poster.jpg"></a>

-----------------
Modern software is built on top of 3rd party APIs and SDKs. But integrating them is time consuming, requiring to manually read docs and copy-paste snippets.

[CommandDash](https://commanddash.io) enables you to **skip reading documentation, and integrate any API or SDK with an IDE agent upto date with latest documentation, examples and issues.**

##### 🙌🏼 Open Marketplace of IDE Agents
##### 🎯 Supports every programming language
##### 💙 Free to every developer.

Our vision is to enable developers to seamlessly integrate APIs and SDKs without leaving their IDEs.
