<h3 align="center">Skip documentation, use IDE Integration Agents</h3>
<img src="/assets/docs/poster.jpg"></a>

-----------------
Modern software is built on top of 3rd party APIs and SDKs. But integrating them is time consuming, requiring to manually read docs and copy-paste snippets.

[CommandDash](https://commanddash.io) enables you to **skip reading documentation, and integrate any API or SDK with an IDE agent upto date with latest documentation, examples and issues.**
