Our vision is to make Flutter development seamless by automating low-level tasks while also making it easy for non Flutter devs to adopt and build production-ready apps in no time.


## Dash AI: Just Like a Mini-Engineer

Imagine Dash AI beyond code writing. It can run and debug your app, listening to real-time log outputs and device screen (multimodality) to iterate the code until your goal is met. Just like we devs do ourselves.

Acheiving this requires below requirements to be fulfilled.

**1. Full contextual knowledge**
**2. Upto date with latest syntax**
**3. Ability to run and operate the app**

The specifics of each step is defined in the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md). We are setting a timeline of 4-6 months to achieve them.

## Contributing

A copilot for all is best built if all of us contribute. You can make contributions to the VSCODE or IntelliJ extension or also to [CommandDash CLI](https://github.com/Welltested-AI/commanddash) shared between the extensions.
