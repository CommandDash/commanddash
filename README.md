<h4>Use ChatGPT right inside your IDE to create, refactor and debug Flutter code</h4>
</div>

-----------------
FlutterGPT is an open-source project aimed at creating a coding assistant specifically designed for Flutter Engineers. This assistant helps with creating, refactoring, and debugging code, making the development process more efficient and enjoyable.

We're starting with simple features to create, refactor, and debug with a vision to build a supercharged, free-to-use coding assistant built for and by Flutter Engineers.

We only use GPT3.5 because it's fast, highly accurate, cheap, and is available to all.
