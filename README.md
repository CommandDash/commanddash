# fluttergpt README

FlutterGPT is an experiment to create a coding assistant catering needs specific to Flutter Engineers.

We're starting with features to
1. Create
    - widgets from description
    - classes and methods just from a blueprint.
2. Refactor
    - code with language instructions.
    - and fix runtime errors directly by sending the error description.
3. Explain
    - and get simple explanations of complex functions. 

    with a vision to build a supercharged, free to use coding assistant built for and by Flutter Engineers.

We only use GPT3.5 because it's fast, highly accurate, cheap and is available to all.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements
1. You'll need an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com) with a valid API key.

## Post Installation

After installing the extensions, please visit your VSCode setttings, search for `fluttergpt.apiKey` and paste the OPENAI API Key.
