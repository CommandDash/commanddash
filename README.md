</p>

#### 1. **From Instruction**

Refactor widgets and logic both with this command.

Command: `FlutterGPT Refactor: From Instructions`

#### 2. **Optimize Code**

Pass your runtime errors and get fixed code back.

Command: `FlutterGPT Refactor: Optimize`

#### 3. **Auto Fix**

Select any method or code with errors, run Auto Fix .

Command: `FlutterGPT Refactor: Fix Errors`

### üìù Add to Reference

LLM's work great when provided with references along with the instructions. FlutterGPT users can now add any piece of code or customized descriptions as reference and they'll be passed to model for any command being used.

**Practical usecases:**

1. Having widgets follow a state management and use a view model already defined in your code.

2. Use snippets as a reference while refactoring large part of projects to use the same style and structure.

3. In, `codeFromBluePrint` to generate full-fledged classes taking state management, architecture and style as reference from an existing class.
