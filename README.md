# fluttergpt README

FlutterGPT is an experiment to create a coding assistant catering needs specific to Flutter Engineers.

We're starting with simple features to create, refactor and debug with a vision to build a supercharged, free to use coding assistant built for and by Flutter Engineers.

We only use GPT3.5 because it's fast, highly accurate, cheap and is available to all. 

## Features

### Create 
a. Widget from Description
b. Model Class from JSON (Freezed, JsonSerializable with copywith function)
c. Repository Class from Postman Json
c. Complete Code from BluePrint

### Refactor
a. Anything with Instructions
b. Fix Errors


## Requirements
1. You'll need an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com) with a valid API key.

## Post Installation

After installing the extensions, please visit your VSCode setttings, search for `fluttergpt.apiKey` and paste the OPENAI API Key.

Please Note: Using OpenAI APIs will incur charges. From our observations, running 300 create widget from description costs only 1$.
